# Bike-Renting-Prediction
Whether it's to boost your fitness, health or bank balance, or as an environmental choice, taking up bicycle riding could be one of the best decisions you ever make. Remember the days of the bicycle built for two, when tourists rented bikes to explore island areas where cars either didnâ€™t exist or were blessedly limited? Those days are still here, but the majority of bicycle rental businesses are clustered around heavily trafficked tourist spots. The objective of this case study is the prediction of bike rental count on daily based on the environmental and seasonal settings. The dataset contains 731 observations, 15 predictors and 1 target variable. The predictors are describing various environment factors and settings like season, humidity etc. We need to build a prediction model to predict estimated count or demand of bikes on a particular day based on the environmental factors.
